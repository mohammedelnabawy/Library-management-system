# Library-management-system
This software project is designed for managing and maintaining libraries in any educational institution through an integrated computerized system. The library management software will allow librarians to operate more productively while handling the typical day-to-day tasks of a library. All the library operations and records, including the number of books, genres of books, names of books, records of the students whoâ€™ve browed/returned books, etc. The software includes different modules, each of which handles and manages specific library operations. By using this software application, librarians and students need not search the entire library to find a book. They can enter the name and author of the book, and the system will display the list of all the possible books available for that search keyword/phrase. This is one of the best features of this library management software.
